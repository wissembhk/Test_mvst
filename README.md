# Github Mirror App with  React TypeScript

This project is a simple usage of Github api V4 which is built using GraphQl .
To try it you can either visit : https://github-mirror-test.herokuapp.com/ ( if you are using chrome it will show you a security issue but don't worry it's just because I'm using a free version of Heroku that don't provide you an SSL )
or you can clone this repo  and follow the next steps to run it correctly

## Steps to Run the project locally

To run the project on your local machine , you need to :

### `1.Create a .env file`
 - In order to set up the enviroment variables you should first generate a github token ( you can find how to generate one in github Developer settings )
 - Create a .env file in the root ( you can follow the .env.example)
 - Add your token to the .env file 


### `2.npm install`

In order to install the packages you only need to run the <b>npm install</b> command in your terminal ( make sure you run it on the project directory )

### `3.npm start`

Once everything is ok you are ready to go , simply run <b> npm start </b> command to start the project
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

## Future improvements
 - Improve the ux/ui part of the project especially on the computer version
 - Implements tests

## Feedback

I would really wants to thanks MVST. team for this test because it was my first time to face two of my weak points which are working
with graphQL (this test was my first experience) and React Ts ( I was always using Js with React and Ts with angular )
So this test represented an opportunity for me to try new things.

### Note :
I will be sending a github api token valid for 30days starting from 18/10/2022 via mail or you can just generate one from developer settings interface
